                <h1>Interspecies Friendship</h1>
    
                <p>An interspecies friendship is a nonsexual bond that is formed between animals of different species.[1] Numerous cases of interspecies friendships among wild and domesticated animals have been reported and documented with photography and video.[1] Domestication of animals has led to interspecies friendships between species that would never naturally exist together.
                Your animal companion is a listening ear, someone to take care of, as they take care of you. They remind you to be in the joy of the moment. As with any deep friendship, your relationship with your animal affects your life… and it affects your animal friend's life, as well.

                <h2>Lion Biography</h2>
                <p>The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera native to Africa and India. It has a muscular, deep-chested body, short, rounded head, round ears, and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail. It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions are larger than females and have a prominent mane. It is a social species, forming groups called prides. A lion's pride consists of a few adult males, related females, and cubs. Groups of female lions usually hunt together, preying mostly on large ungulates. The lion is an apex and keystone predator; although some lions scavenge when opportunities occur and have been known to hunt humans, the species typically does not.</p>

                <h2>Tiger Biography</h2>
                <p>The Bengal tiger is a population of the Panthera tigris tigris subspecies.[2] It ranks among the biggest wild cats alive today.[3][4] It is considered to belong to the world's charismatic megafauna.[5]

                The tiger is estimated to have been present in the Indian subcontinent since the Late Pleistocene, for about 12,000 to 16,500 years.[6][7][8] Today, it is threatened by poaching, loss and fragmentation of habitat, and was estimated at comprising fewer than 2,500 wild individuals by 2011. None of the Tiger Conservation Landscapes within its range is considered large enough to support an effective population of more than 250 adult individuals.[9]</p>

                <h2>Snake Biography</h2>
                <p>Snakes are elongated, limbless, carnivorous reptiles of the suborder Serpentes /sɜːrˈpɛntiːz/.[2] Like all other squamates, snakes are ectothermic, amniote vertebrates covered in overlapping scales. Many species of snakes have skulls with several more joints than their lizard ancestors, enabling them to swallow prey much larger than their heads with their highly mobile jaws. To accommodate their narrow bodies, snakes' paired organs (such as kidneys) appear one in front of the other instead of side by side, and most have only one functional lung. Some species retain a pelvic girdle with a pair of vestigial claws on either side of the cloaca.</p>
